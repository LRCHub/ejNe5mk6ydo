Tied on a stone, he's born as hero
Died on his feet, he's known forever
Born with a halo of frenzy, you black-browed
Cú Chulainn, Cú Chulainn
Mighty Cú Chulainn, even death you defy
Cú Chulainn
Still he stands where the raven lands
With Emer as his bride
Small and youthful
The son of Lugh and Deichtine
He killed the guard dog
Killed the monster of Culann
Yeah, kill the monster of
Culann in warp spasm
Cú Chulainn, snared by love
Mighty Cú Chulainn, only love makes you weak
You left your wife and fell for fand
Mighty Cú Chulainn, return to Emer
Drink the cup and wipe away all the memories
You will ride to the dawn
Ride with Láeg, pass the sea
Bring your loyal wife
Bring your ever true bride
Cú Chulainn, Cú Chulainn
Mighty Cú Chulainn, even death you defy
Cú Chulainn
Still he stands where the raven lands
With Emer as his bride
The legend of Cú Chulainn
Flies across the land
Like the spear of your fate
Cú Chulainn
Still he stands where the raven lands
With Emer as his bride
The legend of Cú Chulainn
Flies across the land
Like the spear of your fate
